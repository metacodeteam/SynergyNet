# Dataset
Dataset Our dataset is available in the Google Drive(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hvHoa-vBgbHG7Nbtbti1o5o2DYKez8uW?usp=drive_link). To train the model with the dataset we created, you can copy the contents of the dataset folder to the /data folder of the model.
# How To Run 
1. pretrain_ppi.py    STEP1: the graph contrastive learning model
2. train.py      STEP2: the DDS model
